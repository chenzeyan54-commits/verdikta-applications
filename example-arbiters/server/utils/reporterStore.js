/**
 * Reporter Delegation Store
 *
 * Lets an arbiter owner authorize a *different* address to post watchdog
 * events on its behalf (POST /api/alerts), without putting the owner key on
 * the node.
 *
 * Why this exists: ingest authenticates an event by recovering its EIP-191
 * signer and requiring it to equal the operator contract's on-chain `owner()`.
 * Operators commonly run their nodes with a separate ops wallet — the owner
 * key controls the wVDKA stake, `deregisterOracle`, and ETH earnings, so
 * copying it onto an internet-facing box just to send a health ping is a bad
 * trade. Those nodes sign with a key the server doesn't recognize and every
 * heartbeat is dropped with a 403, so the arbiter silently shows as "not
 * reporting".
 *
 * The fix keeps the trust root exactly where it was — only `owner()` can
 * authorize a reporter, proven by an owner signature — but moves *where* that
 * signature is produced. The owner signs a delegation in the browser on
 * /my-arbiters (MetaMask personal_sign; no transaction, no gas) and the site
 * POSTs it here to be stored. Ingest then accepts either the owner or a live
 * delegate. Nothing on the arbiter node changes: the watchdog keeps sending
 * the payload it sends today.
 *
 * Delegations are scoped to (owner, network), not to a single operator: one
 * ops wallet typically fronts an owner's whole fleet, and owner-scoping means
 * one signature also covers operators registered later. Ingest already
 * resolves `owner(operator)` for its own check, so the lookup is free.
 *
 * Bounded blast radius: a delegate can only assert *health status* for
 * operators its delegator already owns. It cannot fulfill requests, move
 * stake, or claim earnings. Delegations carry a hard expiry (the client
 * defaults to 90 days, DELEGATION_MAX_TTL_MS caps any request) and can be
 * revoked by a second owner signature, which leaves a tombstone so a replayed
 * `add` cannot resurrect the delegate.
 *
 * Pending reporters: because the node is never modified, an owner has no way
 * to discover *which* address to authorize. So a rejected-but-well-signed
 * event is recorded here as a "pending reporter" — someone holding key K
 * claims to run operator O — and surfaced on /my-arbiters as a one-click
 * Authorize prompt. The event signature is verified before this point, so an
 * entry proves possession of K; it is only ever an *offer*, and authorizing
 * still requires the owner's signature. Bounded per operator and expired on
 * read so it cannot grow without limit.
 *
 * One JSON file per network at `server/data/{network}/reporters.json`,
 * matching the alertStore / gasReceiptStore convention:
 *
 *   {
 *     "updatedAt": 1779848153911,
 *     "delegations": {
 *       "0xowner…(lower)": {
